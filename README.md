# PCA-convergence-rate-improvement

During the course *Mathematical methods in data science and signal processing* I enrolled as a Master's degree my final project was to implement and improve the results presented in the article "A Stochastic PCA and SVD Algorithm with an Exponential Convergence Rate".

The arXiv to the original article is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2848)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/DinorNagar/PCA-convergence-rate-improvement.git
'''


## Suggested Improvement
The better optimization can be achieved by changing the constant decaying step size suggested in the article ($\eta$)

## Results
My suggested improvement compare to oja algorithm and vr_pca algorithm for mnist dataset where k=1 is given below:
