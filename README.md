# PCA-convergence-rate-improvement

During the course Mathematical methods in data science and signal processing I enrolled as a Master's degree my final project was to implement and improve the results presented in the article "A Stochastic PCA and SVD Algorithm with an Exponential Convergence Rate".

The arXiv to the original article is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2848)

The final grade for this work was **94**.
